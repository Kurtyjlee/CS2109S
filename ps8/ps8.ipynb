    "### 1.1 Concept - How can K-means be used to compress images?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Typical Image Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we attempt compressing images, let us have a look at how images used in this problem set are represented digitally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a colour image `I` that has a height of $h$ pixels and width of $w$ pixels, i.e. it contains $h \\times w$ pixels. Then, it can be represented by a 3D array that has the shape $(h, w, 3)$, since each pixel has 3 values -- one for each of the RGB (red, green and blue) channels -- that determine the pixel colour. To be more specific, a pixel located at the `i`th row and `j`th column of image `I` contains `I[i][j][0]`, `I[i][j][1]` and `I[i][j][2]` amount of red, blue and green respectively, where $0 \\leq$ `I[i][j][c]` $\\leq 255$, with $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the pixel along the 3rd row and 5th column is black, we will have `I[3][5][0]` $=$ `I[3][5][1]` $=$ `I[3][5][2]` $= 0$; and if the pixel along the 2nd row and 1st column is white, we will have `I[2][1][0]` $=$ `I[2][1][1]` $=$ `I[2][1][2]` $= 255$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation for Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that based on the above image representation, to encode the amount of red in one pixel, we need 8 bits (to represent values from 0 to 255), likewise for the green and blue channels. In other words, we will need a total of 24 bits to encode each pixel's colour. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, upon closer inspection, we will notice that we do not in fact need 24 bits for each pixel because the number of distinct colours in a natural image is often much less than $2^{24}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the perceptible difference in colour between pixels with RGB values that only differ slightly is usually minimal. Therefore, we can afford to conflate colours with similar RGB values without a significant loss in visual quality of the image. The example in the figure below illustrates this. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/colour_differences.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview of Compression Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of accommodating all $2^{24}$ colours in the RGB colour space, we shall limit the possible colours to some fixed $k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $k \\geq 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select these $k$ colours from the $2^{24}$ colours in the RGB colour space, we shall use the _K-Means algorithm_, with the pixel values as input data, to find $k$ _clusters_. Then, the $k$ _centroids_ of these clusters will be the $k$ colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, every pixel $p$ in the $i$-th cluster, where $0 \\leq i < k$, will be recoloured to the its centroid's value. For example, if the zeroth centroid is $[253, 0, 0]$ and $p_0 = [255, 0, 0]$ is assigned to the zeroth cluster, then in the compressed image, $p_0$ will have a value of $[253, 0, 0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then represent the compressed image `I'` of `I` with a sequence `S` of $k$ colours, and a 2D $h \\times w$ matrix, where $0 \\leq $ `I'[i][j]` $< k$. Then, when rendering the image on screen, the pixel along the `i`th row and `j`th column will have the colour given by `S[I'[i][j]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this proposed encoding of an image can reduce the memory requirements for storing the image because now, each pixel only needs $\\lceil log_2k \\rceil$ bits instead of 24 bits. Alas, the reduction is dependent on our choice of $k$ (since a larger $k$ means that we will incur a greater overhead cost for encoding `S`), and the dimensions of the image."

    "##### Example on how K-Means can be used to compress image \n",
    "\n",
    "The images demonstrate the use of K-Means in image compression. The original image is a shaded gradient from red to blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/red_blue.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When K-Means is applied with k=30, the image is compressed into 30 different shades of color. Each shade is formed by grouping similar pixel colors together based on their proximity to each other. The result is a compressed image with 30 different color regions instead of the original gradient. The images below show the compressed image when k = 30, k = 10 and k = 2 respectively.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/compressed_red_and_blue_k=2.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, K-Means can be used in image compression by grouping similar pixels together and reducing the overall number of colors in an image. This technique can help to reduce file size and processing time without significantly affecting the visual quality of the image if k is chosen correctly."

    "## (Informal Re-)Introduction to PCA\n",
    "This subsection introduces the principles of PCA. If you are already familiar with PCA, you can skip this section and go to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understanding Data as Signal and Noise\n",
    "Before we can get into PCA, we need a common understanding of what *data* really comprises of. In particular, one way of viewing data is that it is composed of *noise* and *signal*. Here, *signal* simply refers to the 'true' underlying measurements, in the absence of *noise*. Now, it should be clear that a dataset that is of 'high quality' is one that has high signal but low noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importance of Feature Variation\n",
    "Assuming we have a high-quality dataset, we expect the features that are critical for differentiating one class of objects from another to be significantly different. Therefore, the variation in these features among the different data points should be higher. In contrast, features that are less critical will tend to have no, or minimal variation that is caused by (the low level of) noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it makes sense for us to ignore features having less variation, but retain features having higher variation. Not only will this help us to get rid of features that are unimportant or noisy, it will also simplify the data by reducing its dimension, in turn making processing more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Dimension Reduction of Binary Images\n",
    "To make things more concrete, let us consider a simple example. Suppose we have two binary images (i.e. images where each pixel is either 0 or 1, with 0 resulting in a black pixel and 1 resulting in a white pixel) as shown below. Moreover, to represent each binary we can represent each binary image as a 1D array of size 25, denoting each pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<tr align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <td><img src=\"images/zero.png\" width=\"300\"></td>\n",
    "    <td><img src=\"images/one.png\" width=\"300\"></td>\n",
    "</tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that, in fact, the 16 pixels around the perimeter will not help us to differentiate the image '0' from the image '1', since they have the same values (0) in both images. In other words, we can ignore these features, and instead represent each image with a 1D array of size 9, where it represents the $3 \\times 3$ in the center. Notice that this array has significantly fewer entries than the original one, i.e. the dimension of the data has been reduced, and we have effectively changed the coordinate system when changing the image's data representation. In general, this is what we hope to achieve: **reduce the dimension of the data while maintaining most of the variation in the data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dimension Reduction with PCA\n",
    "Unfortunately, in most real world scenarios, features that are deemed less relevant are not so obvious. In fact, this is exacerbated by the presence of noise and more complex data. Thus, we need a more sophisticated and systematic way to do dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, *variance* is used to quantify the variation in the features of different data points, and results from linear algebra (more precisely, eigenvectors and SVD) are used to determine how the coordinate system should be changed such that the variance of the data points, as defined in this new coordinate system, is maximized. In essence, this is what PCA does.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given data points with $D$ features, PCA will systematically transform these $D$ features into $N$ features (often, these new $N$ features are a combination of some features of the original dataset, before PCA is applied.), where $N \\leq D$ and $N$ is a user-specified value, such that the variation of the transformed data along these $N$ axes is maximised."

Therefore, if each column of `A` and `X` represent the same feature(In fact, more importantly, we need `A` and `X` to be samples that are drawn from the same population.), we expect that most of the variation in `A` to be retained after transformation as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these, you might find `pca.explained_variance_ratio_` insightful. In particular, it returns an array of length $N$ such that the $i$-th entry indicates, out of the total variance in the data, how much of it is contributed by `X` along the $i$-th transformed axis. Note that the axes have been chosen such that an axis, along which there is more variation, is placed towards the left. Therefore, the values in `pca.explained_variance_ratio_` is non-increasing, similar to what we have seen in lecture 11. To put it differently, in the transformed coordinate system, axes that are more important come before those that are less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you may need `pca.inverse_transform(A_transformed)` for this problem set as well. This function works as follows. Suppose the output from this function is `A`'. Then, `A`' is an approximation of `A`(It will be exact, however, if we choose $N = D$, where $D$ is the number of axes in the original coordinate system). As such, if $N$ is chosen appropriately, we will expect `A`' and `A` to be close; however, if $N$ is chosen to be too small a value, `A`' might not represent `A` well since when transforming `A` to `A_transformed`, a significant amount of signal from `A` has been lost in the smaller coordinate system. \n",
